# zambian-salaries
An app pooling information from the Zambian public freely entering their salaries anonymously to promote salary transparency 
Most of the time, people undersell themselves when negotiating salaries. To promote better bargain for professionalâ€™s and salary transparency in Zambia, I created this lite app which people can anonymously add their salaries. The information in it is pooled from you, the public.

Initially it was an open shared Google Sheet, but due to vandalism and people deleting (accidentally I believe) some entries, I had to come up with a simple app format in which people can still view and add information. Clicking on an entry shows you the details which include years of experience, company size, qualifications and other factors which determine salary rate.
